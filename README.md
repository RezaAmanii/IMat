# How to open IMat

"projectbackend.jar is a library that should be placed in a suitable location in the same way as the backends used in the labs.

iMatApp.zip is a shell application that can be launched. It contains projectbackend.jar. You can also start from iMatMini as shown in the lecture and clear it of content. As usual, settings for JavaFX need to be configured.

imat.zip contains images, etc. Start by unpacking it. Then move the 'imat' folder to the '.dat215' folder located in your home directory if you have run any labs. If you're unsure where the home directory is, you can find it using the code snippet:

System.getProperty("user.home");

producteditor.zip contains a small program that can be used to browse through the assortment. Unpack the zip file and run producteditor.jar. Depending on the system, you can double-click the jar file or execute the command:

java -jar producteditor.jar."
